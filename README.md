#NAME
sphere-enable-standalone - when installed, this package enables standalone mode

#HOW IT WORKS
This package installs an environment variable which has the effect of adding --noCloud to the sphere client startup 
arguments which, in turn, causes the sphere client to startup as an standalone master. This allows the sphere to 
operate independently of the cloud.
